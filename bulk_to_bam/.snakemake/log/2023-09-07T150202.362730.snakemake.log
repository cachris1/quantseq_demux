MissingOutputException in rule cellranger_combined in file /home/cachris/geneva/lyria/bulk_to_bam/Snakefile, line 306:
Job 132  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
21-4_barn/possorted_genome_bam.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
