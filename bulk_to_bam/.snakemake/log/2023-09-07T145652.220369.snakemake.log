File path /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/logs/cellranger2//home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/cellranger_outputs/8-3.log contains double '/'. This is likely unintended. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake.
AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules cellranger and cellranger_combined are ambiguous for the file /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/cellranger_outputs/8-3/possorted_genome_bam.bam.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	cellranger: sc_samples=8-3
	cellranger_combined: sc_samples=/home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/cellranger_outputs/8-3
Expected input files:
	cellranger: /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/data/TSHG10_hypoxia_GENEVA
	cellranger_combined: /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/data/TSHG10_hypoxia_GENEVA
Expected output files:
	cellranger: /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/cellranger_outputs/8-3/possorted_genome_bam.bam
	cellranger_combined: /home/cachris/geneva/hypoxia/cellranger_outputs/8-3/possorted_genome_bam.bam
